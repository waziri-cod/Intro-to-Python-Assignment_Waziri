# 🎉 Welcome to the Fun Calculator! 🎉
# We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! 😎

# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
# We're using 'float()' to make sure our numbers can have decimals too. Fancy, right? ✨
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
# Same trick here—using 'float()' for decimal magic! 🧙‍♂️
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Time to do some math! 🧠 Let's compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# Add the two numbers (Yay! Addition is the first step to fun!) ➕
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Step 4: Show the user what we got! 🥳 Time for the big reveal! 🎉
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  # ➕

# 🏁 And that's it! You've just made a mini-calculator! 😎💻
